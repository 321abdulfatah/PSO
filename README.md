# PSO


Implementation of PSO on two voices to separate them


## Code

This project contains:

	1- Python (.py) files to implement the PSO (Particle swarm optimization)
	2- voices (.wav) files for algorithm application.


## Files

* Python files:
    * main.py: _main script to load data, run PSO generate plots, and play audio._
    * PSO.py: _contains functions to implement PSO._
    * plotting_functions.py: _contains functions to visualize data._

* Audio files:
    * Two voices for a male and female
    
    
    
#### Note

This project is designed for research purposes in separating voices and improving the quality of voices after separation
